				Artemis is a pure, virgin deity described to be the best hunter out of the Gods. A Goddess of the hunt, and a great one at that, she was often worshipped by hunters in Greece to gain her blessing in the hunt which may or may not have included fishing. As many, especially Greece’s population, thrived off of hunting and farming as a mountain filled country. They were quite dependent on the food that a hunt would bring, to how many goats, deer, boars or bears they could bring back home. Food that would feed themselves, their dogs, their family, their horses, their friends or food to sell for trade. Men often went out in search of deer or any edible animal and such often praying to Artemis for a bountiful hunt which made her quite an important deity in their eyes, as without her they would starve.

				It wasn’t only men who worshipped her though; women also owed great debt to the twin of the Apollo. Artemis, being a goddess of birth and chastity, was a sort of guardian to those pregnant with kids and those unmarried, those avoiding pregnancy/marital affairs. She protected women from dangers, from men, to the dangers of pregnancy, dangers of war, dangers of natural disasters and much much more. This is quite important considering that if there were no children being born; it would cause a large horde of problems for both gods and humans.  She was said to punish those who would break vows of chastity, thus instilling a belief among those people to keep that vow, lest they face her wrath.

				Anytime something like a fruitful, bountiful hunt or a good, safe and happy birth to a child would happen, she was often shortly praised after, sacrifices to her would be made like offering up a portion of the hunt like deer or goat to her or clothes were offered up in her name. Sometimes even Bows and Arrows were given to her, among other things of course. Even Spartans made blood sacrifices to her for good luck. And who wouldn’t want to worship and sacrifice for Artemis given all of the things she does for humans at the time. The photo on the left is The Temple of Artemis, found in Ephesus, Turkey. It was actually rebuilt 2 times after being destroyed 3 times by fire, the Gothic Invasion and a Christian Mob respectivly at different times. Now all that remains is the foundation of the temple and a single column. Seen below.

				She was said to, much like her father, have a very short temper. And while at sometimes it was justified, both in reason and punishment, she still had a short temper, and the since the  Greeks, men and women, feared the wrath of a goddess who controlled a large amount of food and childbirth and one who could send plagues, sabotage  up hunts, turn people into bears and possibly cause a famine. It was safe to say some worshippers definitely worshipped her out of fear. Which is a good thing; I too would rather worship someone than upset a short tempered yet beautiful goddess such as Artemis.  I would rather not go hungry and have women suffer, and be unprotected during labor and childbirth.
