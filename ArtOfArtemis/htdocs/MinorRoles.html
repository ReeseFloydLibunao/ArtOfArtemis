		<h1 id="MRHeading"> Minor Roles of The Goddess of The Hunt </h1>

				While still being my favorite goddess in Greek Mythology, one holding great power and a story I find interesting. Though, I will admit her to this fault, one regarding her very very short temper(maybe as short as her we never got the real height or Artemis), her wrath, fury, her rage can be both good and bad depending on what scenario she was in. She was also quite cunning, being a goddess of The Hunt requires such a thing, which also includes her creativity in some of her punishments and methods. This is turn made her an interesting character to write off and make stories about in Greek Mythology. This personality lead to many many many  interesting stories(though some of them are probably lost to time). I can only list a few here since I need to focus on other things though I can assure you, they are my favorites. </p>

				The photo above this paragraph is a depiction of Actaeon, a hunter in the woods with a pack of dogs who depending on your version of the story,  either spied on or accidentally saw Artemis either bathing alone or bathing with other girls. This of course angered the Goddess and she promptly turned him into a deer, otherwise known as a stag. And since Actaeon brought an entire pack of HUNTING dogs, you can guess what they would do to the poor fella. Mauled to death by his own dogs, deserved. He probably ended up in Tartarus after that(or at least he would deserve to be), moral of the story, don’t spy on girls(duh). There was also another story in where she (spoilers) shot her best friend and possibly lover <a href="Orion.html"> Orion </a> for making her love him so hard, more details here or in the <a href="Orion.html"> Orion </a> Page.

				Another story involves Callisto, a hunting companion to Artemis who swore chastity. She shows why you shouldn’t break the chastity vow, especially when you’re angering two goddesses of chastity. Furthermore when the affair you are having is one of the two goddess’ husband. Callisto, with Zeus being in love with her, was turned into a bear in 3 different ways, one by Zeus to hide her from Hera, one by Hera and one by Artemis because she broke her chastity. And either on purpose or by accident(because how are YOU going to tell if the bear you are hunting is was your friend all along), Artemis ended up shooting Callisto in her bear form(nice shot). Out of pity, Zeus put her in the sky in the form of a constellation, “Ursa Major”, which also makes the shape of the big dipper, though the big dipper is just a portion of Usra Major. Which is quite fair considering it was essentially Zeus’ fault, especially if Callisto wasn’t consenting.  Which yes, makes this(to my knowledge) the second constellation Artemis is involved in.

				Another Story is one involving the Mighty Heracles catching the Cerynthian Hind(which was sacred to Artemis) in his 3rd Labor. In some versions, when Artemis got the prompt from Zeus to catch her own 5 golden stags to pull her own chariot(because she asked Zeus for those), She only got 4 of the 5 stags, the other one got away because of how fast those golden deer were. And in other versions it was just a deer Artemis found cute. But nonetheless, Heracles was tasked by King Eurystheus to catch the Cerynthian Hind for one of his 12 labors; it took him an entire year to finally get a catch. And while Artemis was definitely about to smite Heracles for possibly trying to kill the deer, Heracles explained his situation(the whole killing his family thing) and Artemis let him take the deer to King Eurystheus to complete that labour. And I have no clue what happened to the deer afterwards. Since in some versions it was just Artemis’ deer and not the lost one, but it was sacred to her.

				A few other minor mentions are when the Olympians were invaded by Giants and that time where 2 giant sons of Poseidon stacked mountains to reach Olympus. Starting off with the former, when Kronos chopped off Uranus’ genitals, the drops of blood fell on earth, otherwise known as Gaia, spawning the giants from his blood. And Gaia, who was fed up with Uranus, Kronos and Zeus’ constantly ignoring her despite her giving them aid to kill their fathers. Decided to command those giants to invade Olympus, when the Olympians got word of this, they were told they can only win with the help Heracles which made him also there. Artemis’ contribution here was shooting the giant Gration allowing Heracles to kill him. Now onto the Ladder where the 2 sons of Poseidon and Princess Iphimedia, Otus and Ephialtes, grew to massive, MASSIVE sizes, around 50ft in height by the time they were 9 years old. On a side note they also trapped Ares in a jar for 3 months. Now, Otus and Ephialtes both wanted Artemis and Hera as wives which caused them to start stacking mountains to reach Olympus. The cunning Artemis turned herself into a deer and leapt between the two giants, causing them to want to shoot the deer(by instinct of being hunters) but both of them ended up missing and shooting each other(I don’t know how or why they have their own separate giant bows that they can shoot).
