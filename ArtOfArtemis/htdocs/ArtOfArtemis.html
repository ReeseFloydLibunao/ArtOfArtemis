				<p id="HOMEResidencyContent">  <span id="HOMEspan1"> Residency </span> Here we detail Artemis' complex yet fascinating beginnings. From her being yet another child of zeus being born from an affair, and yet another one whom Hera despises and whose mother was viciously hunted down by Hera. And a god who was uniquely, a twin of another god, Apollo.  To her eventual rise to Olympus through a little bit of bargaining with Zeus. </p>

					<p id="HOMEOrionContent"> <span id="HOMEspan2"> Orion </span> A quite famous son of Poseidon, being a very popular constellation and all. He was a very influential figure in Artemis’ life. A close friend with Artemis, our dear Orion was. Despite her friend group primarily consisting of mostly nymphs and forest creatures, she befriended this kind and gentle son of Poseidon. Until tragedy, in the form of someone’s deception, struck the poor giant. In the form of a familiar golden arrow fired from a silver bow….</p>

					How and why she was worshipped, from sacrificing as always to making beautiful statues and paintings of her.  She was mainly worshipped through sacrifices and prayers of course, with deer, bears, clothing, fish, dogs and many other things, like how any other god was worshipped. And worshipping a deity responsible for making sure you are fruitful in the hunt of food you need to, y’know, stay alive, is pretty important. Giving birth is also pretty important; we should probably praise the god who oversees that process.</p>

			<p id="HOMEMinorRolesContent"><span id="HOMEspan3"> Minor Roles </span> A few of the minor roles she had in mythology as a whole. Helping against a war against giants, some kids stacked mountains on top of each other to reach Olympus; Hercules was trying to redeem himself, from turning a girl named Callisto, who broke a vow of chastity, into a bear or something. She has appeared a handful of times in other stories, though she herself is very distant from Olympus, preferring to spend more time in the woods with her girlfriends. She still has many minor roles in others’ stories.</p>
